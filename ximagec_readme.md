Here's a detailed markdown document that explains the Docker setup and configuration for your Flask application.

## Docker Setup and Configuration for Flask Application

This document provides a step-by-step guide to containerize your Flask application using Docker and Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Project Structure

Ensure your project structure looks like this:

```
my-flask-app/
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── requirements.txt
├── app.py
├── config.py
├── utils.py
├── routes.py
├── effects_aggregator.py
├── templates/
│   └── upload.html
└── static/
    ├── css/
    │   └── styles.css
    └── js/
        └── scripts.js
```

### Dockerfile

Create a `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your project. This file contains instructions on how to build the Docker image for your Flask app.

```dockerfile
# Use a specific stable Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Install necessary system packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    libgl1-mesa-glx \
    libglib2.0-0

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install setuptools and wheel first
RUN pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 5000

# Define environment variable
ENV FLASK_APP=ximagec.py

# Run the Flask application
CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
```

### Docker Compose Configuration

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of your project. This file allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    environment:
      FLASK_ENV: development
    depends_on:
      - redis
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

### requirements.txt

Ensure your `requirements.txt` contains all the necessary dependencies for your Flask application.

```txt
Flask==2.1.1
Pillow==9.0.1
numpy==1.22.3
scipy==1.8.0
redis==4.2.2
opencv-python-headless==4.5.3.56
```

### Flask Application Entry Point

Ensure `ximagec.py` is the correct entry point for your Flask application and contains the necessary code to start the application.

```python
from flask import Flask
from routes import main

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object('config.Config')
app.register_blueprint(main)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Building and Running the Docker Containers

1. **Build the Docker Image**:

   Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command to build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Containers**:

   After successfully building the image, run the following command to start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

### Accessing the Application

Once the containers are up and running, you can access your Flask application in a web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Troubleshooting

- **Check for File Existence**: Ensure `ximagec.py` exists in the `/app` directory inside the Docker container. You can check this by running a shell inside the container:
  ```bash
  docker run -it --rm <image_name> /bin/sh
  ```
  Then, list the files in the `/app` directory to ensure `ximagec.py` is there.

- **Correct Flask Environment Variables**: Make sure the `FLASK_APP` environment variable is set correctly to the name of your main application file without the `.py` extension.

- **Dockerfile Syntax**: Ensure there are no syntax errors in the Dockerfile.

### Conclusion

By following this guide, you should be able to containerize your Flask application using Docker and Docker Compose, making it easier to manage dependencies, ensure consistency across different environments, and scale your application.
